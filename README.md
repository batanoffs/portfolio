This project is just a simple web app build with vite, typescript, react and tailwind to showcase my work.
It fetches github `readme.md` files and displays them directly on project pages with the help of `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` libraries.

Tools and technologies:
- react
- tailwind
- typescript
- react-markdown
- react-player
- react-slick
- react-toastify
- remark-gfm
- slick-carousel
- vite
